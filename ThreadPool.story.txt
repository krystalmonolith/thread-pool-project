Create a multi-threading framework library for Node.js. 
The framework will be written in Typescript, and it will use RxJS v7 Observables, and will be packaged as a npm package. 
The framework will be comprised of multiple Typescript classes.
The framework will implement a pool of threads that read and execute tasks supplied by one or more FIFO queues.

The classes will be named: ThreadPool, ThreadQueue, AbstractThreadTask. 

An AbstractThreadTask class is a generic abstract container class for a callback function with signature "threadFunc<T, I extends Observable<T>, V, R extends Observable<V>>(I i, threadId: number):R" .
The threadFunc callback is the code that will be executed individually by each thread in the thread pool.
The ThreadTask class will supply an "execute(threadId: number):void" method that is used by the thread pool to invoke the threadFunc.

Each ThreadQueue class will provide a FIFO queue of ThreadTask class instances.

The ThreadPool class will support N execution threads where N is defined by the Node.js API os.availableParallelism(). 
When the ThreadPool class is constructed it must be supplied a non zero length array of ThreadQueue class instance(s) called threadQueueArray.
The Threadpool.start method will iterate through threadQueueArray starting threads for each AbstractThreadTask in every queue contained in the threadQueueArray by concatenating the arrays into a list.
If the length of the list of AbstractThreadTask is zero then ThreadPool.start immediately returns null.
If the length of the list is greater than zero ThreadPool.start creates threads for each AbstractThreadTask in the resultant list.
When all the threads from that list have been started ThreadPool.start returns a RxJS Observable that will asynchronously emit the thread completion results for each thread by 
subscribing the the threadProc's returned observable an re-emitting the value on the observable returned from Threadproc.start.
When ThreadPool.start invokes the callback function via AbstractThreadTask.execute it will pass an integer number that is a unique ID for each thread started, which is in turn passed to the threadFunc callback via the threadId parameter.
